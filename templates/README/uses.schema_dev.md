* **schema_dev**:  %GEM_MODULE% uses [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) to
  facilitate running rspec tests on the matrix of ruby, activerecord, and database
  versions that the gem supports, both locally and on
  [travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/SchemaPlus/%GEM_NAME%)

  To to run rspec locally on the full matrix, do:

        $ schema_dev bundle install
        $ schema_dev rspec

  You can also run on just one configuration at a time;  For info, see `schema_dev --help` or the [schema_dev](https://github.com/SchemaPlus/schema_dev) README.

  The matrix of configurations is specified in `schema_dev.yml` in
  the project root.
